    "\t•\tInstead, measure effect size for each factor within each product.\n",
    "\t•\tExamples:\n",
    "\t•\tη² (eta squared) or partial η² from ANOVA → “proportion of variance explained by factor”\n",
    "\t•\tIntraclass correlation (ICC) for market effect → tells how much variance comes from between-markets vs within-markets\n",
    "\t•\tYear-on-year R² → how much of the variance is explained by year\n",

    "\t•\tTo compare, compute the relative effect size (like % variance explained) rather than absolute test statistics.\n",
