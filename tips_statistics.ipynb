    "\t•\tSignificance (p-values, F-tests) are tricky when groups have very different sample sizes.\n",
    "\t•\tInstead, measure effect size for each factor within each product.\n",
    "\t•\tExamples:\n",
    "\t•\tη² (eta squared) or partial η² from ANOVA → “proportion of variance explained by factor”\n",
    "\t•\tIntraclass correlation (ICC) for market effect → tells how much variance comes from between-markets vs within-markets\n",
    "\t•\tYear-on-year R² → how much of the variance is explained by year\n",

    "\t•\tA product might only exist in 2 markets. Another might be in 15.\n",
    "\t•\tTo compare, compute the relative effect size (like % variance explained) rather than absolute test statistics.\n",
    "\t•\tThat way, both products can still be compared on “season explains 30% of variance” vs “market explains 5%”.\n",
