    "Rolling Correlation Approach\n",
    "\t1.\tChoose a commodity (say Tomato).\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tPivot the data so each product type under Tomato (e.g., Deshi|FAQ, Other|FAQ) has its own time series column.\n",
    "\t2.\tSelect a rolling window\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tFor daily data, common choices are:\n",
    "\tâ€¢\t7-day â†’ captures week-to-week co-movement.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\t30-day â†’ captures month-to-month trends.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tThe window size affects smoothness vs. responsiveness.\n",
    "\t3.\tCompute rolling correlations\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tFor each pair of product types, compute correlation across that rolling window.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tExample: correlation of Tomato|Deshi|FAQ vs Tomato|Other|FAQ in the last 30 days.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tThis gives a time series of correlation values.\n",
    "\t4.\tInterpretation\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tIf rolling correlation stays consistently high (close to 1) â†’ these products move together â†’ strong co-movement.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tIf it fluctuates (sometimes positive, sometimes negative) â†’ co-movement is not stable.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tIf it stays low or near zero â†’ products move independently.\n",
    "\t5.\tVisualization\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tLine plot of rolling correlation vs. time.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tMultiple lines if comparing several product pairs.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tThis will clearly show periods of alignment vs. divergence."
