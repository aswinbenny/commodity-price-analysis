    "Rolling Correlation Approach\n",
    "\t1.\tChoose a commodity (say Tomato).\n",
    "\t•\tPivot the data so each product type under Tomato (e.g., Deshi|FAQ, Other|FAQ) has its own time series column.\n",
    "\t2.\tSelect a rolling window\n",
    "\t•\tFor daily data, common choices are:\n",
    "\t•\t7-day → captures week-to-week co-movement.\n",
    "\t•\t30-day → captures month-to-month trends.\n",
    "\t•\tThe window size affects smoothness vs. responsiveness.\n",
    "\t3.\tCompute rolling correlations\n",
    "\t•\tFor each pair of product types, compute correlation across that rolling window.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: correlation of Tomato|Deshi|FAQ vs Tomato|Other|FAQ in the last 30 days.\n",
    "\t•\tThis gives a time series of correlation values.\n",
    "\t4.\tInterpretation\n",
    "\t•\tIf rolling correlation stays consistently high (close to 1) → these products move together → strong co-movement.\n",
    "\t•\tIf it fluctuates (sometimes positive, sometimes negative) → co-movement is not stable.\n",
    "\t•\tIf it stays low or near zero → products move independently.\n",
    "\t5.\tVisualization\n",
    "\t•\tLine plot of rolling correlation vs. time.\n",
    "\t•\tMultiple lines if comparing several product pairs.\n",
    "\t•\tThis will clearly show periods of alignment vs. divergence."

    "\t3.\tSlope of Rolling Regression\n",
    "\t•\tFit a small regression of one product vs another in each rolling window.\n",
    "\t•\tIf slope > 0 consistently → trends aligned (they rise/fall together).\n",
    "\t•\tIf slope < 0 → opposite trends.\n",
    "\t•\tThis captures magnitude + direction.\n",
    "\t4.\tCross-Correlation of Returns\n",
