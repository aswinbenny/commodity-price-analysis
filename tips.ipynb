    "\n",
    "Are VFPCK markets more price stable across seasons than non-VFPCK?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",
    "\t•\tIf VFPCK’s goal is to stabilize markets and protect farmers/consumers, then they should buffer seasonal shocks better.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do:\n",
    "\t•\tFor each commodity:\n",
    "\t•\tCompute season-wise price standard deviation for VFPCK vs non-VFPCK.\n",
    "\t•\tRank commodities where VFPCK has lowest volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Insight: “VFPCK reduced price volatility in 62% of local vegetables, especially during monsoon transitions.”\n",

    "📈 2. Price Spike Detection (Seasonal Extremes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there certain markets or commodities that consistently spike during specific seasons?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",
    "\t•\tHigh spikes → opportunities for government to intervene, stockpile, or regulate.\n",
    "\t•\tCould be exploited by middlemen.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do:\n",
    "\t•\tFlag commodities with extreme quartile jumps across seasons.\n",
    "\t•\tCross-check which markets consistently trigger those jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Insight: “Drumstick prices spike by over 250% in VFPCK markets during summer — suggesting mismatch in local supply/demand.”\n",

    "📉 3. VFPCK vs. Non-VFPCK Margins (Normalized by Grade/Variety)\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing same variety+grade, are VFPCK markets more affordable for the consumer or more profitable for the farmer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",
    "\t•\tYou can objectively evaluate whether VFPCK delivers on fair trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do:\n",
    "\t•\tPick top 5 local vegetables with known seasonality.\n",
    "\t•\tFor each, compare average modal price at VFPCK vs non-VFPCK controlling for grade/variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Insight: “In 4 out of 5 vegetables, VFPCK pays farmers 10–15% more for Grade A produce without significantly inflating market price.”\n",

    "🧭 4. Market Dependence Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Do some markets become over-reliant on one or two commodities in certain seasons?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",
    "\t•\tSuggests lack of crop diversification — vulnerable to climate/rainfall disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do:\n",
    "\t•\tFor each market:\n",
    "\t•\tCalculate the % of volume or price share of each commodity per season.\n",
    "\t•\tFlag markets with >70% share by just one or two items.\n",
    "\n",

    "🔮 5. Price Change Forecasting Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there seasonal lead indicators that can help predict future price hikes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",
    "\t•\tBuild an early warning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do:\n",
    "\t•\tLag the seasonal features: If price of Ashgourd jumps during monsoon, what happens to Pumpkin after 2 weeks?\n",
    "\t•\tYou may find linked commodities.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Insight: “Ashgourd price increases during Monsoon are followed by Pumpkin price rises in Post-Monsoon — possibly due to substitution or climate conditions.”\n",

    "📦 BONUS: Cross-Market Arbitrage Opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there any commodity where prices in two nearby markets differ consistently enough to allow resale?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",
    "\t•\tFarmers/traders can use this to plan logistics.\n",
    "\t•\tPolicy makers can optimize transport subsidies.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Insight: “Carrot is priced ₹10/kg higher in Market A than Market B consistently in winter — transport cost is only ₹4/kg, indicating arbitrage window.”\n"
